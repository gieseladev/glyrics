One, one, one, one, one

Talking in my sleep at night

Making myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out
Hoping it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)

My love
He makes me feel like nobody else
Nobody else
But my love
He doesn't love me, so I tell myself
I tell myself

One:  Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two:  Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three:  Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him
You ain't getting over him

I got new rules - I count 'em
I got new rules - I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules - I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

I keep pushing forwards
But he keeps pulling me backwards
(Nowhere to turn, no way)
(Nowhere to turn, no)
Now I'm standing back from it
I finally see the pattern
(I never learn, I never learn)

But my love
He doesn't love me, so I tell myself
I tell myself
I do, I do, I do

One:  Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two:  Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three:  Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him
You ain't getting over him

I got new rules - I count 'em
I got new rules - I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules - I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

Practice makes perfect
I'm still tryna learn it by heart
(I got new rules - I count 'em)
Eat, sleep, and breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it, 'cause I (I got new)

One:  Don't pick up the phone (yeah)
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone (alone)
Two:  Don't let him in (uh-ooh)
You'll have to kick him out again (again)
Three:  Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him
You ain't getting over him

I got new rules - I count 'em
I got new rules - I count 'em
(Whoa-ooh, whoa-ooh, whoa)
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules - I count 'em
(Baby, you know I count 'em)
I gotta tell them to myself

Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't
You're gettin' over him
